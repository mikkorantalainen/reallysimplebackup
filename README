README for reallysimplebackup
=============================
reallysimplebackup is a collection of scripts to do a simple rotating backup
of the whole system. Behind the curtains, the scripts use rsync, cp -al and
hardlink. Scripts are written in bash and python.

See the manual page for more information.

 * DESTDIR - May be set to another root system (useful for packaging)
 * PREFIX  - Normally usr, may be changed to usr/local
 * MANDIR  - Normally $(PREFIX)/share/man (some systems may use $(PREFIX)/man)
 * CONFDIR - Normally $(PREFIX)/etc/reallysimplebackup

Additional notes
----------------

This package doesn't specifically store list of installed packages. A good solution for that would be to periodically run

    aptitude search -F "%p" '~i !~M'

and store the output. That will emit list of packages that are not installed as automatic dependency. Installing this list of packages should result in system
that has all the same software.

See https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/aptitude/ch02s05s01.en.html for possible details to log about packages.
